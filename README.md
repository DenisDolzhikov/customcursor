# Custom Cursor Effects

Custom cursor effects demo and tutorial for [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/).

Thanks [IamManchanda](https://github.com/IamManchanda) for the nice dev setup [gulp-webpack](https://github.com/IamManchanda/gulp-webpack), which I forked for this project.

## Setup

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- Optionally, also install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or use _Npm_ that comes with Node pre-installed
- Install Gulp globally through `npm install -g gulp@next`
- Install Webpack globally through `npm install -g webpack`
- Install all [packages](./package.json) with `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Usage

- **Build the Project and Serve locally (for Production)** - `npm start` or `yarn start`. The Production port is `8000`.
- **Build the Project and Serve locally (for Development)** - `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`. The Development port is `3000`.
